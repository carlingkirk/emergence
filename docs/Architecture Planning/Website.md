- [Add CI with Github actions](../../../../../emergence/projects/2#card-41213683) As a devops engineer, I want to setup CI so I can prevent commits that break the build or unit tests.


Stuff:
- Azure
- PWA for easy mobile
- Blazor?
- .NET Core
- Data storage
  - Azure tables to start?
  - Abstract for easy switching
- Microservices?
